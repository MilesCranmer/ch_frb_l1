// This is a toy program which simulates a packet stream at the full CHIME data rate,
// for timing purposes.  The receiver will usually be the counterpart toy program 'ch-frb-l1'.
//
// It can be pointed at any IP address, but we usually just run over the loopback IP 127.0.0.1.
//
// A major caveat is that the intensity values it sends are just arbitrary numbers, not
// something more interesting like Gaussian random noise, or even more interesting such
// as noise + simulated FRB's.  This is because the current simulation code is too slow
// to simulate anything interesting (even Gaussian noise) at the full CHIME data rate,
// and fixing this is a to-do item (see discussion in ch_frb_io/README).
