# This is "example 2", in the section "Quick-start examples
# which can be run on a laptop" in MANUAL.md.

# In this toy example, we use 4 beams and 1024 frequency channels.

nbeams: 4
nfreq: 1024

# In this example, we split the data between UDP ports 6677 and 6678.
# (Beam IDs 0+1 will be sent to port 6677, and beam IDs 2+3 will be sent to port 6678.)

ipaddr: "127.0.0.1"
port: [ 6677, 6678 ]

# Total number of threads used by the L0 simulator.
# Note: nthreads must be a multiple of the number of "streams", which
# is the number of distinct (ipaddr,port) pairs (in this case nsteams=2).

nthreads: 2
