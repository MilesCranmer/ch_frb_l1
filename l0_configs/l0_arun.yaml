# This is a config file for 'ch-frb-simulate-l0'.
#
# It is intended for a specific situation during Arun's visit:
#    - L1 code is running on frb-compute-0
#    - frb-compute-0 interfaces are configured as 10.0.0.10x, with no link bonding
#    - L0 code is running on frb-l2l3, but for reasons we don't understand the 10 Gbps
#      interface is throttled to 1 Gbps

nbeams: 16
nupfreq: 16

# Divides data into four "streams", with four beams per stream.
# In this configuration, each stream is on a different 1 Gbps interface, but a different UDP port.
ipaddr: [ "10.0.0.101", "10.0.0.102", "10.0.0.103", "10.0.0.104" ]
port: 6677

# Four threads total (i.e. one per stream, it is possible to assign more)
nthreads: 4

# This optional parameter artificially throttles the packet output rate,
# in this case to 0.2 Gbps/stream (i.e. 0.8 Gbps total).
gbps_per_stream: 0.2
