# assembled_chunk_ringbuf_capacity
#   (optional, default=8)
#
# This is the capacity of the ring buffer (in assembled_chunks, approximately 1 second each) between the assembler 
# thread and the processing thread.  This buffer is logically separate from the telescoping_ring_buffer.
# If the processing thread is running slow, this ring buffer will fill, and assembled_chunks will be dropped.

# telescoping_ringbuf_capacity 
#   (optional, default=[])

# This is a list of buffer lengths, starting from the least-downsampled level of the buffer, and ending in
# in the most-downsampled level.
