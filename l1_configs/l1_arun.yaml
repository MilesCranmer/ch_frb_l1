# This is a config file for 'new-ch-frb-l1'.

# It is intended for a specific situation during Arun's visit:
#    - L1 code is running on frb-compute-0
#    - frb-compute-0 interfaces are configured as 10.0.0.10x, with no link bonding
#    - L0 code is running on frb-l2l3, but for reasons we don't understand the 10 Gbps
#      interface is throttled to 1 Gbps

nbeams: 16

# Divides data into four "streams", with four beams per stream.
# In this configuration, each stream is on a different 1 Gbps interface, but a different UDP port.
