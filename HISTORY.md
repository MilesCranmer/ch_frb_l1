- v2: from Dustin:
  - L1 server module
  - Full python client
  - Partial C++ client
  - Add ch-frb-test.cpp, which simulates a set of L0 nodes and a set of L1 nodes 
    and has them talk to each other (and has L1 RPC servers).
 
- v1: mostly a placeholder, but contains:
  - "global" instructions for compiling the chimefrb pipeline ([INSTALL.md] (./INSTALL.md))
  - pointers to scattered documentation
  - some toy programs for timing the chimefrb networking code
