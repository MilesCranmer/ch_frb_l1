External dependencies:

  - A gcc which is recent enough that C++11 and AVX2 are supported.  I know that gcc 4.8.1 works, and that 4.4.7 is too old.
  - A very recent cython.  I know that cython 0.24 works, and cython 0.20 is too old.
  - numpy/scipy/matplotlib
  - hdf5 version 1.8.11 or later
  - h5py version 2.4.0 or later
  - FFTW3 (http://fftw.org)
  - The 'PIL' python imaging library.  If you need to install it, I recommend the Pillow variant ('pip install Pillow')
  - jsoncpp
